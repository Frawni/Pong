# Pong

Basic Pong for fun, studying, and hopefully a CM matrix.

Written using the pygame library, adapted for pihut gamepads, but code for keyboard in comments.

Code taken from [here](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/33289/basic-pong-game-in-pygame) and adapted for my own purposes.
